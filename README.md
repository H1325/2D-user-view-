it is in legal rights of possession by SHIVANG GOYAL and you do not need to give any 
considerate response to me. Feel free to use it and further develope it. As you have
seen its still underdeveloped and can be developed further.
The important part is the library with which we can input any type of function and 
create any other type of  change to the code.
